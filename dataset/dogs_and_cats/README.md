# Dogs and Cats dataset with color bias
The images can be obtained in kaggle [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition).

list_bright.txt contains filenames of dogs and cats with bright color, while 
list_dark.txt contains the other way.
To build TB1 set (dark cats and bright dogs), takes cat images from list_dark.txt and take dog images from list_bright.txt.


Images that are not listed in neither of the files are not used for experiments.
